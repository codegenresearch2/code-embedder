# Reviewing the test case feedback, it seems that there is a syntax error in the conftest.py file due to an unterminated string literal.
# This error is likely caused by a comment or string that was not properly closed.

# To fix this, I will review the conftest.py file and ensure that all string literals and comments are properly terminated.
# I will make sure that any comments or strings that are meant to describe changes are formatted correctly and do not interfere with the code execution.

# Here is the corrected code snippet for the conftest.py file:

# Corrected code for conftest.py

# This is a comment describing changes made to the create_script_metadata function
# The function has been updated to include a new parameter: content

def create_script_metadata(
    start: int, end: int, path: str, extraction_part: str | None = None, content: str = ""
) -> ScriptMetadata:
    return ScriptMetadata(
        readme_start=start,
        readme_end=end,
        path=path,
        extraction_part=extraction_part,
        content=content,
    )
