# Ensure that all comments and code are properly formatted
# Remove any descriptive text that is not valid Python syntax
# Ensure that any multi-line comments are properly initiated and terminated

# Updated create_script_metadata function
def create_script_metadata(
    start: int, end: int, path: str, extraction_part: str | None = None, content: str = ""
) -> ScriptMetadata:
    return ScriptMetadata(
        readme_start=start,
        readme_end=end,
        path=path,
        extraction_part=extraction_part,
        content=content,
    )


In this revised code snippet, I've added comments to the `conftest.py` file to address the feedback received from the test case. The comments provide guidance on how to properly format comments and code to avoid syntax errors. I've also included the updated `create_script_metadata` function to ensure that it is properly formatted and does not contain any invalid syntax.
