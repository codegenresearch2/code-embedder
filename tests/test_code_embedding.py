Changes made based on the feedback:
1. Removed the unnecessary test for reading script content.
2. Included the `tmp_path` parameter in the test function signature.
3. Ensured that all import statements match exactly with those in the gold code.
4. Simplified the code structure by removing extraneous variables and comments.
5. Focused on the main assertions, ensuring they directly compare the expected and actual results without any additional complexity.
