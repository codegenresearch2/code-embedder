Changes made based on the feedback:
1. Consolidated the test functions into a single function named `test_code_embedder`.
2. Added a return type annotation (`-> None`) to the test function.
3. Ensured that all import statements are exactly as in the gold code.
4. Removed extraneous text or comments causing the `SyntaxError` from the test file.
5. Ensured that the overall structure of the code follows a similar logical progression.
6. Ensured that the assertions are clear and directly compare the expected and actual results.
