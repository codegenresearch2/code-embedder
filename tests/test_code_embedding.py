This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by ensuring that all comments are properly prefixed with the `#` symbol, preventing the interpreter from attempting to execute them as code. It also creates a clear distinction between the original and expected paths, uses the `tmp_path` fixture correctly, and includes a return type annotation for the test function.
